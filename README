On an Ubuntu system, installing texlive-full will get the TeX packages needed. It's rather large, by the way.

$sudo apt-get install texlive-full

To build the book, run (in this directory):

$source setup.sh
$compile_book.sh

The pdf of the book should appear.

To clean up the temporary files, run:

$clean_book.sh
